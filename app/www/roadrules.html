                * Enable inline JS: add 'unsafe-inline' to default-src

                                <p>Children are among the category of road users who require much attention since they are vulnerable road users. The mental perception of the average child has not reached its full capacity and therefore children tend to lack coordination and good judgement. These precious gifts should be taken care of on the roadways and should be taught how to carefully and responsibly develop into safe road users. Parents should take the time to teach children how to cross the road and when it is safe to do so. Drivers and other road users should look out for children and assist them wherever it is necessary. Parents can teach their children some of the following tips that will assist in protecting our precious gifts.</p>

                                <h5><strong>WEAR A HELMET AT ALL TIMES</strong></h5>
                                <p>Protect your head. This is the first and last rule of bicycle safety. A good helmet may save your life and may be your only defence against variables you cannot control. Be sure you wear a helmet that is carefully fitted to your head and fasten the strap.</p>
                                <h5><strong>ADHERE TO THE RULES OF THE ROAD</strong></h5>
                                <p>Just as automobiles and other vehicles on the road must follow standard operating procedures designed to ensure safety, facilitate the flow of traffic and maintain order on our roads, pedal cyclists, if they are to share the road with motorized vehicles, must cooperate accordingly.</p>
                                <ul>
                                <li>Ride with the traffic.</li>
                                <li>Plan and signal well ahead.</li>
                                <li>Make no sudden moves - except in self defence or in an emergency.</li>
                                <li>Stop and wait at stop signs and red lights when in traffic or on busy streets. Maintain your place in the right lane and let everyone around you know what you plan to do.</li>
                                <li>Give others on the road plenty of time to adjust their speed and position to accommodate you.</li>
                                <li>Avoid surprising others on the road e.g. ring a bell when coming out of narrow or obscure pathways, signals the direction you intend to turn.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p><strong>ALWAYS HAVE AN ESCAPE </strong></p>
                                <p>Expect the unexpected.</p>
                                <h5><b>MAINTAIN YOUR BICYCLE IN EXCELLENT CONDITION</b></h5>
                                <p>Your ride will be safer, more fun if your bike is in excellent operating condition. Have a bicycle technician check your bicycle to make sure it is the right size for you.</p>
                                <ul>
                                <li>Adjust the seat and handlebars to the proper height and position.</li>
                                <li>Tires should be in good condition and properly inflated. Carry a spare inner-tube and a pump - learn how to change a tire.</li>
                                <li>Your brakes should be properly adjusted with plenty of pad.</li>
                                <li>Check all cables every time you ride. Replace frayed cables immediately.</li>
                                <li>Your chain and gears should be free of dirt and grease. Most people put too much lubricant on their chain.</li>
                                <li>Tighten all loose screws and nuts. If you can hear a rattle or rub while you are riding you need to stop, isolate and correct the problem.</li>
                                <li>In low lights conditions you should have reflectors - on your bicycle and on your clothing, helmet. At night you should have lights - in front and behind.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <h5><strong>KNOW YOUR LIMITATIONS AND PLANS YOUR RIDES</strong></h5>
                                <p>Are you physically prepared for the ride ahead? Do you know where and how far you are going? Are you dressed properly? Are you prepared for changes in weather? Have you had enough to eat? Do you have enough water with you?</p>
                                <ul>
                                <li>Do not ride if you feel dizzy or out of breath.</li>
                                <li>Keep hydrated at all times.</li>
                                <li>Avoid riding in the sun all day or extremely bad weather such as rain storms.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <li>Grip the grab rail, or hold the rider at the waist and grip with your knees under braking.</li>
                                <li>Pick a shoulder to look over and don't change shoulder or wiggle about when cornering or braking.</li>
                                <li>Stay still as the motorcycle is coming to a stop, to aid the rider's ability to feel the balance of the machine.</li>
                                <li>Keep your feet on the foot pegs at all times.</li>

                                <li>The driver and passenger need to agree on a method of communication.</li>
                                <li>The pillion needs to be shown how to get on and off the bike.</li>
                                <li>The passenger should also use feet on the pegs and grip with legs to ensure a tight connection with the bike.</li>
                                <li>The passenger needs to know about hot parts of the motorcycle, including pipes and brake discs, and any other potential hazards or fragile equipment.</li>
